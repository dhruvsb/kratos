# Work Log

Append-only, dated log of individual sessions. This is the **history**; the
`PROJECT-SUMMARY-PHASE*.md` files are the **current-state snapshot**. When you finish a
session, add an entry here (newest at the top) and update the relevant summary file's
status table/decisions — don't let the two drift apart.

## 2026-07-18 — Phase 1 setup verified against real Supabase project

**Session scope:** Phase 1 only. User created their Supabase project and filled `.env`.

**Verified (against the live project, not just files on disk):**
- Migrations applied: all 8 Phase 1 tables present and queryable.
- Seed ran: 873 exercises, 217 aliases in the DB; `search_exercises` spot-checked
  with "RDL", "OHP", "incline db" — all resolve correctly.
- `npm run test:rls` executed for real: all 8 two-account isolation checks passed.

**Not done / next up:** only the human step remains — log 4 consecutive real
workouts in the app. Nothing left to build for Phase 1.

## 2026-07-18 — Phase 1 finalization

**Session scope:** Phase 1 only. Closing out everything that doesn't require the
user's real Supabase credentials.

**Built:**
- Verification pass: `tsc --noEmit` clean; `npx expo export --platform web` bundles
  all 9 routes with no errors.
- Added `npm run seed` and `npm run test:rls` convenience scripts (were long `npx tsx`
  commands before).
- Confirmed `0002_voice_logs.sql` (Phase 2, added by the parallel session) is purely
  additive and doesn't conflict with anything Phase 1 depends on.

**Not done / next up:** everything remaining is account setup + real usage — create
the Supabase project, fill `.env`, apply the migrations, run seed + RLS test, log 4
real workouts. See `PROJECT-SUMMARY-PHASE1.md` § 3.

## 2026-07-18 — Phase 2 backend: parsing pipeline

**Session scope:** Phase 2 only (Phase 1 is being built in a parallel session).

**Built:**
- Shared `ParseResult` / `ParseContext` zod schemas (`supabase/functions/_shared/parse-types.ts`)
- Extraction + exercise-resolution prompts and LLM call logic
- Exercise matching: exact → trigram fuzzy → LLM-pick-from-candidates, never free-generated
- `parse-utterance` Supabase Edge Function (auth-guarded, logs telemetry to `voice_logs`)
- `0002_voice_logs.sql` migration: `voice_logs` table + `search_exercise_candidates()` SQL function
- Cost-tracking constants for Claude Haiku 4.5 (default parsing model) and Claude Sonnet 5
  (mid-tier comparison model)
- 25-exercise in-memory fixture, standing in for the real library until Phase 1 seeds it

**Not done / next up:** `parse-cli.ts` local test script, the eval golden set + runner,
model-comparison mode, the voice capture UI, the telemetry dashboard. See
`PROJECT-SUMMARY-PHASE2.md` § 2 for the full status table.

**Decisions made this session:** see `PROJECT-SUMMARY-PHASE2.md` § 4 (not duplicated
here — that file is the source of truth for current decisions).
